# Learning Rust (_lrs_)

The learning rust (_lrs_) series of repositories have no ambition to contain
production grade code. The main objective is for the author to learn more about
the Rust programming language.

Sources are thrown online with proper copyright(left) notices, just in case
anyone would want to put them to use anyway.
